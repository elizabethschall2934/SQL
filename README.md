# SQL
The purpose of this activity was to design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. 

Tasks performed:

Data Engineering

Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables.  Create an image file of the ERD.
Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files, specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
Create a .sql files for the table schemata and queries.
Use primary keys or create a composite key if needed.
Create tables in the correct order to handle foreign keys.
Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.
